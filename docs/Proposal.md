Problem Statement
-----------------

Task managers face the issue of time consuming readjustments of scheduled tasks that can be addressed by linking and grouping tasks. The ideal state of affairs is to allow the user to quickly create tasks and to quickly adjust the overall schedule. The issue with task managers is that if adjustments are needed the user may have to manually adjust multiple tasks one at a time, this process is time consuming. Resolving this issue can be done by linking and grouping tasks to be able to apply changes to many tasks at once. This solution also has the benefit of providing greater capability of organizing tasks. The organization of tasks helps to show the relationship tasks have to one another that can help the user understand the importance of completing the task. The issue of too much time being spent on readjustment of the overall task schedule can be greatly reduced by the feature of linking and grouping tasks.


Project Description
-------------------

The project is to develop a product that can help users with managing their tasks. The product will allow users to create tasks and fill in various details. The product will allow the user to link tasks together along with grouping them. The product will allow users to move and modify tasks and adjust the related linked tasks. The product will have a simple user interface to reduce complexity to allow the user to understand the tool quickly. The product will have the ability to mark tasks status(i.e. To do, in progress, done ). The product will allow the user to mark the importance of the task(i.e. Low priority, mid priority and high priority). These feature all for the purpose of organizing tasks and allowing quick adjustment of tasks.


Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

C++


Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QT

Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------

List any hardware needed and software (e.g., your IDE).

Personal Motivation
-------------------

This project will further my knowledge as it will allow me to experience a long term project. Being of a longer duration the project will allow for greater planning, considerations and exploration of various aspects of computer science. For instance the priority of the project would be the functionality but with the additional time a focus can be on making the product enjoyable for the user. The time could also be spent implementing various functions of the program of greater numbers than previous projects. This will be valuable to understanding how complex projects can become when features increase. The experience of completing a product that has had more consideration in functionality and user experience in a state that is very polished will teach the importance of planning, organization and inspection. The product itself will also be useful to me as a tool that I can use in daily life. The product will have solved the issue stated in the problem statement that affects me which is part of my motivation for this project. 

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

I will be exploring the tool QT to determine how to implement the project. The exploration will be done by using the tool itself, finding various documentation on QT on the internet and videos showcasing the tool. I will also research various user interface designs/techniques to provide a better user experience. The goal of the user interface research will be to minimize the learning curve of the tool. As well as optimize the ability for users to quickly adjust their tasks with minimal user action required. I will also look into the best way to test all components of the product and showcase the tests and results. The rest will be general research into making the product optimized in performance and error free.

Schedule
--------


- Fall 2025 - CSCI 498
    - September 7: A mockup of the user interface.

    - November 14: A test plan for various features that are planned for implementation. 
    - November 21: A document reviewing the current interface determining what works well and what needs to be improved. 
    - December 1 : Product with all planned features. 

- Spring 2026 - CSCI 499
    - January 21: A document showing the results of the implemented test plan to determine the current state of the product's functionality. 
    - February 7: Bug fixes and updates based on test results
    - February 12: Research on other features that other task managers have or lack to see if the project can be expanded.
